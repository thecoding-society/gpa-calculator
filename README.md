# GPA Calculator

This is a simple GPA calculator implemented in Python. It allows users to calculate their Grade Point Average (GPA) based on their course grades and credit hours.

## How It Works

The GPA calculator takes inputs from the user in the form of course names, grades, and credit hours. It then calculates the GPA using the standard GPA formula. The grades are mapped to their respective grade point values based on a predefined grading scale. The GPA is calculated by summing the grade points for all courses and dividing it by the total credit hours.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or Fork the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd gpa-calculator`
3. Run the `gpa_calculator.py` script: `python gpa_calculator.py`
4. Follow the prompts to enter your course details (name, grade, and credit hours) for each course.
5. Once you have entered all the course details, the GPA calculator will display your calculated GPA.
